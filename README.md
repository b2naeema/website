# website

I have  used several techniques to build this website such as java script, css styling, htmml and much more.

Its a car website which consists of a cars page which shows the cars and their description.
There is also a gallery page where cars can be viewed and the company about us page explaining how big and popular the bussiness is.

The website is responsive. It can viewed by several devices such as iphone samsung & tabs.

Testing inlcudes: 
Checking responsiveness on the devices by inspect element on the chrome browser
Map successfully shows up.
gallery shows all the pics, if you open a pic you can scroll to the next one.
like button gives 1 like per click.
Css styles of all sorts are applied successfully
