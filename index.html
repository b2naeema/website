		<p> Hello! Thank you for taking time out of your day to check out my experience in China. My name is Vishnu Suresh. This is the first blog I created and I thought I would share with you all. I created this blog for the adventurers and go getters of the world.</p>

		<p> I am currently a final year undergraduate student at De Montfort University studying Business Information Systems. I took part in a summer internship in Shenzhen, China through CRCC Asia and DMU Global working for a start-up technology company. After I completed this internship I travelled the whole of China in 21 days!  </p>

		<p> Going to China was a vision I have always had since I was young, and finally I came accross the oppurtunity to not only travel the country but to also gain some valuable work experience in the I.T sector  </p>

		<p> I decided to intern in Shenzhen because I was inspired to work in a technology based environment. Shenzhen is known to be the silicon valley of China with it's technology manufacturing and high demand of artificial intelligence and robotics. Based on my skills and professional experience, the CRCC program placed me with Waiguoren Tech </p>
