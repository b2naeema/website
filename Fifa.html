					Defending is easier. Or at least, defenders are now better equipped to win the ball and compete against attacking players. 
					Slide tackles have regained some of the old potency; players really do slide again, meaning it possible to win the ball from 
					unexpected distance. Well-timed toe-pokes, meanwhile, can satisfyingly break up play, while desperate moments give players more options 
					to deliberately foul players just before they break into space (this is usually harshly punished, but so much fun). I’ve been caught by 
					defenders when I thought I was out of range, I’ve won the ball with crunching block-tackles at fullback, and I’ve used the slide to channel 
					runners by blocking off their path. This new, stronger, more flexible slide tackling is a success.Other noticeable additions to defending 
					include a tackle feint, for counter-baiting tricksy opponents during one-on-one battles. No longer does the protect-the-ball crab pose offer 
					an impenetrable defence; it easier to slip around players in possession of the ball and then get a foot to it. Perhaps most significantly 
					of all, defender AI has been fine-tuned to make more interceptions and to track runners with more doggedness.These last points are the ones 
					that really contribute to FIFA 16 most obvious shift; the fact that the midfield is now a battlefield. Working the ball through the middle 
					of the park feels attritional and muddy, full of physicality and friction. More than ever, it’s a game of inches and interceptions, with 
					defenders urging themselves towards the ball wherever possible, pressing and lunging and reaching out feet. It can get scrappy, with 
					miscontrols and turnovers spilling messily around for a few seconds at a time, but it feels like an organic sort of mess, a footballing mess.

				In response to all this there are offensive tools to make the midfield an even fight, if an asymmetrical one. No-touch dribbling adds 
				another layer to the game’s skill system, enabling players to duck and feint over the ball, looking to send defenders the wrong way. 
				This is pretty but so far, for me, not hugely effective; I rarely had enough space in-field to dance over the ball, and on the wings 
				I went for reliable old step-overs. But more integral is the new precision passing system, which effectively introduces a hard, pinged 
				pass that can be pulled off by holding R1 . It clearly been designed as a foil to the stickier, interception-prone midfield, and 
				it comes with an element of risk and skill. Lesser players are more likely to fumble these stinging passes, and judging angles, ability 
				and distance adds a new dimension to the basics of FIFA play.
