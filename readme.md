Abdullah Naeem's Website

If you click on the images they go bigger.


There are three buttons at the bottom Fixed, Resizable, Mobile.
They work but when you first open the website please click fixed button first then click resizable or mobile.
If you dont click fixed first stylesheet doesn't work.

I have added JavaScript to the menu bar.
I have added 3 stylesheets.

I have added javascript for style swapping

If you enter data on feedback form and submit it, it registers it into the MYSQL database.
