					Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary
					 America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in 
					 every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size 
					 or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and 
					 provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.

					Parents need to know that Grand Theft Auto V is an M-rated action game brimming with gang violence, nudity, extremely coarse language, 
					and drug and alcohol abuse. It isn't a game for kids. Playing as hardened criminals, players kill not only fellow gangsters but also 
					police officers and innocent civilians using both weapons and vehicles while conducting premeditated crimes, including a particularly 
					disturbing scene involving torture. Women are frequently depicted as sexual objects, with a strip club mini-game allowing players to 
					fondle strippers' bodies, which are nude from the waist up. Players also have the opportunity to make their avatars use marijuana and 
					drink alcohol, both of which impact their perception of the world. None of the main characters in the game makes for a decent role model. 
					All of them are criminals who think of themselves first and others rarely at all. Few games are more clearly targeted to an adult audience.

					From a technical and design perspective, Grand Theft Auto V sets new bars. 
					The world it presents is unrivalled in authenticity and vibrancy. It feels fluid and alive. 
					Time passes organically, characters' lives progress, and there is a simply astounding quantity of side activities in which to engage. 
					It's quite possible to explore the state of San Andreas for hours without moving the main story forward a stitch. 
					In fact, that's part of the fun. And it's all been polished to a glossy sheen. The controls feel great, the visuals are lush, and a 
					brilliant graphical interface empowers players, giving them all the information they need -- and only the information they need -- 
					exactly when they need it. However, the writing isn't quite as sharp as it has been in previous installments; the humor is a bit broader 
					and less sophisticated, and the main characters aren't as well developed (probably because there are now three), but this only impacts 
					the overall experience a little. It remains a very impressive game.Graphics options are plentiful and powerful, with everything from standard 
					quality and view-distance adjustments to a field-of-view slider (though it’s more limited than discriminating FOV players might want - modders 
					have already remedied that). Controls are customizable, and you can play your own music library on the in-game radio. It’s hard to complain much 
					about that.For the most part, the menus are well done and feel good to use with the mouse. That’s best exemplified with the web browser, which feels 
					like you’d expect navigating a web page with a mouse to feel. The one place this breaks down a little is in the score menus; it’s a little tougher to 
					navigate an Ammunation gun store’s wares with the mouse than it is with a D-pad or arrow keys, but it’s still totally workable. It’s simply a small 
					reminder that this wasn’t originally a PC game.

					Keep in mind, though, that much of the content is unequivocally geared for adult audiences. And even then it will not be for all tastes. 
					Grand Theft Auto V puts players in the roles of criminals who show little remorse for their evil actions, and often even take pleasure in 
					them. It's a dark fantasy with the potential to prove immense fun for those who are mature enough to properly appreciate its adult humor 
					and able to clearly distinguish between right and wrong. It is not a game for younger players with developing psychologies. And adults 
					who don't have a taste for role-playing a life of crime should probably give this game a wide berth.Nice PC-specific control touches, 
					like not having to hammer a button to keep up running speed (just hold down Shift) and being able to hit a single button 
					(Caps Lock by default) to activate a special ability make everything feel like a native PC game. You don’t get the annoying horizontal 
					drift when running in first-person like you do in the PS4 and Xbox One versions, either.One of my favorite things about the control 
					setup, though, is that like GTA 4 and a select few other games before it, GTA 5 lets you seamlessly swap between the mouse and keyboard 
					and a gamepad on the fly. No need to go into a menu and swap - just push a button on one or the other, and all on-screen prompts change 
					to reflect what you’re using. It’s a fantastic thing for a game like this, where running and gunning is more precise with a mouse and 
					keyboard but driving or especially flying benefits greatly from the analog input of a thumbstick. You can even use both at once, if you 
					like.
